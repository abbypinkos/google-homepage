An asssigment from The Odin Project, where I had to build a page that looks like Google's homepage.

Using HTML, I started with the main elements of this page (navigation, search bar, and footer)
and was then able to use CSS to place and style them.

Might be a bit haphazard, as this is one of my first few pages and I have little experience.
